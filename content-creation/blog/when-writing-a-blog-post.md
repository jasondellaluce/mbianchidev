# Todolist blog post

- Choose a topic
- Research: other blogs, videos, papers, books...
- Write a draft with your ideas, just free writing without thinking too much about the structure, grammar or anything else, bullet points are fine too!
- Wait 1-2 days thrn find a **structure** for your post
  - Storyline: what's the story you want to tell? What's the message you want to convey?
  - Paragraphs: try to understand how many you have and how to group them
- Choose images and memes, use excalidraw to draw diagrams
- Choose a **title**: possibly clickbait(y) but not too much, SEO friendly for sure.
- Choose a **subtitle**: explain what the post is about in a few words, no clickbait allowed here
- **Introduction**: must be catchy and make people want to read more
- **Conclusion**: a TLDR of the post with some takeaways
- **Call to action**: what do you want people to do after reading your post? Subscribe to your newsletter? Follow you on Twitter? Buy your book? Hire you? Donate to a charity? Try a product you are sponsoring? Make sure you have a clear call to action and that it's aligned with your goals.
