# New blog post checklist

- [ ] Choose a topic
- [ ] Research: other blogs, videos, papers, books...
- [ ] Write a draft with your ideas, just free writing without thinking too much about the structure, grammar or anything else, bullet points are fine too!
- [ ] Wait 1-2 days thrn find a **structure** for your post
  - [ ] Storyline: what's the story you want to tell? What's the message you want to convey?
  - [ ] Paragraphs: try to understand how many you have and how to group them
- [ ] Choose images and memes, use excalidraw to draw diagrams
- [ ] Choose a **title**: possibly clickbait(y) but not too much, SEO friendly for sure.
- [ ] Choose a **subtitle**: explain what the post is about in a few words, no clickbait allowed here
- [ ] **Introduction**: must be catchy and make people want to read more
- [ ] **Conclusion**: a TLDR of the post with some takeaways
- [ ] **Call to action**: what do you want people to do after reading your post? Subscribe to your newsletter? Follow you on Twitter? Buy your book? Hire you? Donate to a charity? Try a product you are sponsoring? Make sure you have a clear call to action and that it's aligned with your goals.
- [ ] Publish it on the blog platform
- [ ] Re-share on social media
  - [ ] LinkedIn
  - [ ] Twitter
  - [ ] Hackernwes
  - [ ] Re-blog it so it's on multiple platforms? Maybe.
  - [ ] Send it to friends and colleagues on Telegram/Whatsapp
- [ ] Ask to get amplified by someone else, a publication...

If it flops it's okay, just keep publishing :)
