## Description / Abstract

In this talk, I will explore the relationship between socialism and open source. I will discuss how the principles of socialism can be applied to open source projects and communities. I will also discuss how open source projects can be used to promote and support equality and social justice by providing a source of income for people that wouldn't have access to enterprise IT kind of wealth otherwise.
