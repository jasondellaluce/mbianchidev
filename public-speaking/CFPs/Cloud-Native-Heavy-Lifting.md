## Description / Abstract

Downsides of moving a monolith to Kubernetes and its unexpected upsides.

Everyone knows that we are not supposed to run monolithical architectures on Kubernetes but what if that mistake finally brought the whole company together to solve the challenge?

In this talk we will explore how what seemed to be a terrible mistake has become a journey to microservices and complete automation where Software Engineers and DevOps finally worked together to overcome this challenge and achieve a common goal and lifting the monolith weight over their heads.


## Benefits to the Ecosystem

My goal is to demonstrate how something beautiful can spring even from non-optimal architectural and technical choices when people work together and we operate people-first instead of focusing on tools only.

**OSS Project used**: Kubernetes
