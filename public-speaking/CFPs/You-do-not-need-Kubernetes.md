## Description / Abstract

There are many other ways of leveraging containers, Kubernetes is not the silver bullet everyone thinks it is!
Kubernetes is overkill and a simpler solution, more often than not, does well enough.
In this talk I will explain how to leverage containers without Kubernetes and why you should consider it for your next project.

ECS, Azure Container Instances, Fargate or even the simplest Docker compose running on a simple VM instance... These are all valid alternatives to Kubernetes and they can be applied to most use cases where Kubernetes is currently used.
