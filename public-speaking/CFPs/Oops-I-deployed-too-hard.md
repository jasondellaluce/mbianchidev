## Description / Abstract

Sometimes you delete production, you drop tables, you change a conf and everything breaks but what if you upgraded the wrong environment to the next newere and fancier version of one of the biggest customers of your employer?
And what if you did it right before going to a long lunch?

A tale of compliance, regulations, unauthorized deploys and ethical questions!
Solved more through diplomacy than with coding.
Memes included*
