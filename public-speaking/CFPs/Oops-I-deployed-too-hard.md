## Description / Abstract

Sometimes you delete production, you drop tables, you change a conf and everything breaks but what if you upgraded the wrong environment, to the wrong version, of the wrong customer (that also happens to be the bigger your company has)?

And what if you did it right before going to a long lunch?

This is a tale of compliance, regulations, unauthorized deployments and ethical questions!
Solved more through diplomacy than with coding.
