## Description / Abstract

Sometimes you delete production, you drop tables, you change a conf and everything breaks but what if you upgraded the wrong environment, to the next newer and fancier software version, in one of the biggest customers of your employer server?
And what if you did it right before going to a long lunch?

A tale of compliance, regulations, unauthorized deploys and ethical questions!
Solved more through diplomacy than with coding.
Memes included*
