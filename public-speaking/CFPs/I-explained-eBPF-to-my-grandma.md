## Description / Abstract

Imagine a cozy evening after work, spent with a Kubernetes-aware grandma where she asks you about your day, a day you've spent working with eBPF.

Would you reveal the mysteries of eBPF to her or would you keep it a secret?
We have choosen to reveal the secrets of eBPF to our grandmas, comparing it to the secret ingredient that can transform the ordinary kitchen of a tiny restaurant into a Michelin-star kitchen brigade.

We explored how eBPF enables real-time analysis and manipulation of network packets at the kernel level, we drew parallels to how a chef orchestrates its kitchen to prepare perfect dishes and ensure all food is served to the highest standards and no one gets food poisoning (or hacked).

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

Did you ever wondered how to make eBPF accessible to someone with no to little technical background? This talk promises an exploration filled with kitchen-inspired metaphors. 

Whether you're a seasoned (pun intended) eBPF expert or just getting started, come and taste the unique perspective of understanding eBPf through the eyes of an Italian grandma.
