## Description / Abstract

Picture a scene where I'm enjoying a big plate of spaghetti, and my dear grandma, totally unaware of the deep tech world I work in, curiously asks about my job, like she does every xmas.
Seizing this wonderful opportunity, I dove deep into the rabbit hole of container orchestration, trying to make it relatable through her favorite topicâ€”food!

I ended up explaining Kubernetes to her and she started serving homemade biscuits as they were apps.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

If you've ever wondered how to make Kubernetes accessible to someone with no technical background, this talk promises a yummy exploration filled with food-inspired metaphors. 

Whether you're a Kubernetes expert or just getting started, come savor the unique perspective of understanding Kubernetes through the eyes of an Italian grandma serving biscuits to her nephews.
