## Description / Abstract

In this lighthearted and engaging lightning talk, I share my unconventional approach to demystifying Kubernetes by explaining it to my Italian grandma, using food analogies. 
Picture a scene where I'm enjoying a big plate of spaghetti, and my dear grandma, totally unaware of the deep tech world I work in, curiously asks about my job (like she does every xmas).
Seizing the opportunity, I went deep into the rabbit hole of container orchestration, trying to make it relatable through her favorite topicâ€”food!

Join me as I walk you through the entertaining narrative of equating Kubernetes to the art of serving homemade biscuits as they were apps.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

If you've ever wondered how to make Kubernetes accessible to someone with no technical background, this talk promises a yummy exploration filled with food-inspired metaphors. 

Whether you're a Kubernetes expert or just getting started, come savor the unique perspective of understanding Kubernetes through the eyes of an Italian grandma serving biscuits to her nephews.
