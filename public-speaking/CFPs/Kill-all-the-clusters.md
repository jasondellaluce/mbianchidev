## Description / Abstract
_From clusters to namespaces: simplifying the Kubernetes experience_
_How to leverage Open-Source to build a namespaces as a service platform_

This talk describes our take on providing a namespace-as-a-service (NaaS) platform based on Kubernetes and open source cloud native software; as platform engineering and developer productivity become a mantra around which software development and delivery is centered, we identified the namespace as the basic unit of application needed by devs.

We will describe how to achieve strong isolation and multi-tenancy thru OPA policies, network segmentation, virtual cluster and RBAC authorization; showing how we achieved better packaging and multi-tenancy in our shared platform also with a TCO reduction from 30% to 50% and overall less environmental impact, due to better resource utilization (will discuss the sizing model to achieve it). We aim to provide a better understanding on how to build platforms, foster fast prototyping and experimentation and providing ephemeral envs for testing. All of this in a sleek and quick demo, both on bare metal and cloud providers.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

Building an agnostic Platform Engineering tool to help drive DevEx into your team can be challenging, through this talk we want to make everyone realize the power of Namespace as a Service (NaaS) as an abstraction over the complexity of Kubernetes for developers.
