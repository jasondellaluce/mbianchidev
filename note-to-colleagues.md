# User Manual: How to work with me

Hi there future (or current) colleague! üëã

This is a manual to help you understand how to work with me.
Please use he/him pronouns when referring to me, thanks!

I have good intentions most of the time, but being a non-native English speaker I might come across as dry or rude. Let me know if I do, I am on my way to improve!

## Who am I?

I consider myself a very friendly person, I love to help people and I'm always happy to do so.
Only problem is that especially when we first meet I'm quite shy and introverted, so I might not be the most talkative person in the room. Give me some time and I will open up!

If you want to find some common topics to talk about, here's a list of things I like: [here](extra.md)

I'm very passionate about my job and I love to share my knowledge with others as well as learning from others. I usually have a lot of questions and I'm not afraid to ask them (even if they might sound stupid).

- I care about climate change and I'm trying to do my part to help the planet. üå±
- I'm an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
- I care deeply about social issues and human rights but I might not be vocal on the job. ‚úä
I just don't want to do politics or talk about religion at work. I'm really not interested in that.

## Screaming

I can't stand people (regardless of their role in the company) screaming at me. I'm a human being, not a machine. I have feelings and emotions.
I will **never** scream at you, I expect the same from you.

If you're angry it's completely valid. You need to take a break, go for a walk, do something else, then come back and talk about it.

## Touching 

I really don't like to be touched, unless I explicitly ask for it. 
I'm not a hugger on the job. I'm a handshaker, high-fiver and a fist-bumper!

I also don't like if you touch my stuff without asking or when I'm not around. I will notice.

## Context

Are you asking me a question? Context.

Are you giving me specific information about something? Context first!

Are you asking me to do something? Context (and your subjective urgency evaluation), please.

## Communication

- Email ‚úÖ - I check it twice a day (morning and afternoon)
- Slack ‚úÖ - Love them messages and huddles, I check it every 1 hour or so unless I'm mentioned
- Phone (work) ‚úÖ - I reply if I am on-call or if it's an emergency, otherwise I will call you back when I'm available
- Phone (personal) ‚ùå - You probably won't have my personal number (sorry, I separate 100% work and personal life)
- Jira or similar sw ‚ùå - I might be involved in 50+ tickets at the same time, so please message me on Slack or send me an email if you need me to do or check something.
- Social media üü° - I check them once a day and sometimes I don't reply at all, so please don't use them for work-related stuff!

If you use Teams I will suggest you to use Slack instead, way better.

## Hello

See: [No hello manifesto](https://nohello.net/en)

Examples:

"Hello Matteo, how are you? I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I have a question about our Kubernetes Platform. I'm trying to deploy a new API but I'm getting an error, find the logs attached. Can you help me?"

- Polite ‚úÖ
- Straight to the point ‚úÖ
- Context ‚úÖ

"Hey, there's something wrong with that new API Gateway, we need to fix it ASAP."

- Polite ‚úÖ - yep, I consider it polite even without an "hello", it's an emergency!
- Straight to the point ‚úÖ
- Context ‚úÖ

"Hello Matteo"

- Waste of time ‚ùå

"Hello Matteo, have you watched the new episode of [insert TV series here]?"

- Non-work related üü° - I'm fine with non-work topics but please do not send a notification if you can!

## Meetings

Unless necessary, I don't do meetings. I prefer async communication, it's more efficient and it allows me to focus on my work.

If you need to involve me in a meeting be sure to send me an agenda and a clear goal for the meeting.
I will of course join when needed and be super happy to help.

Rule of thumb: if you can solve a problem without me, do it, I trust you.

In case you just wanna chat about random stuff with me I would **love** to have a (virtual or real) coffee break together! ‚òï

## Deep Work

See: [Deep Work](files/deep-work.pdf)

## Bureaucracy

I hate bureaucracy. Strong word but I hate it with all my heart. I will do my best to avoid it.

I don't cope well with it, it makes me feel like I'm wasting my time and I'm not doing anything useful.

Avoid letting me do it if you can, I will be forever grateful and I will stay in the company longer.

## Feedback

I struggle with positive feedback. I'm not used to it and I don't know how to react to it. I'm working on it.

I love constructive (negative) feedback, I'm always trying to improve myself and I'm happy to receive feedback on how to do it.

I will ask for a lot of advice rather than feedback, I'm more comfortable with that and I find it more actionable.

## Mistakes

I won't blame anyone for making mistakes, I make a lot of them myself. I ask you to do the same and in return I will try to learn and make the most out of them. If we are not making mistakes we are not learning.

p.s. If we have a good relationship I might make fun of you for making a mistake, but I will do it in a friendly way and expect you to do the same, I promise!
