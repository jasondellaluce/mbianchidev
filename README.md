#### Hi there!

My name is Matteo but my nicknames are many, depending on the many context you find me in (gaming? reddit? music?).

In my spare time I [mentor](https://mb-consulting.dev/mentor) people, [help startups](https://www.mb-consulting.dev/service/mentoring-services) filling their tech gaps and [blog](blog/blog.md) about tech and life.
I organize(d) Kubernetes Community Days in the Netherlands.

#### Long story (never) short

My story is filled with monstrous bugs üêû, amazing features ‚ú®, large scale products ‚õ∞Ô∏è, many programming languages and frameworks üìö, huge infrastructures üóº and amazing colleagues üë®‚Äçüíª.

As employee I started as Software Engineer and then joined the Dark Side of DevOps and Site Reliability taking the best from both worlds (I've never stopped to use the --force).

The reason I decided to start my journey in 2021 as a freelance professional was to scale up my impact on the industry and to help more people to achieve their goals.

As a freelancer I coached and mentored my padawans (ehm I mean, my students) about DevOps principles and practices. I also helped companies to improve their DevEx and DevOps approach.

In the time I've been in the IT industry, up and down since 2015, I've learned a lot from hands on experience and had the opportunity to interact with truly amazing people.

In 2023 I took the next step and I've been the CTO of a startup for one year, where I enjoyed the challenge of building a new company culture, a service and a product from scratch and of course taking care of my team.

In the end we could not find the Product-Market Fit and had to step back, but quoting Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is."

I advocate for Cloud Native technologies, I'm a k8s lover and part of the CNCF community.
My hottest take of 2023: Platform Engineering is "just" DevOps on steroids.

In 2024 I'll try to move, possibly away from Europe and hopefully starting a new exciting adventure in the software industry!
