#### Note to recruiters and companies

I consider myself a **Cloud Native Engineer** because I'm not "just" a Software Engineer or DevOps Engineer with extensive Site Reliability experience.
I'm a cloud expert, a DevOps coach, an experienced coder in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Golang, TypeScript...), a mentor, an international speaker, a tech writer, a community builder and a lot more.
I think differently, I operate differently and I'm certainly not afraid to challenge the status quo.

I don't really like resumes but I have a public one, ask me for it if you really need it.

Regardless of freelancing or employment, from companies I work with I expect the following...

##### Must 

- Not operating in the following fields:
  - Military / Weaponry
  - Gambling / Online-Casino
  - Shitcoin (crypto scams) / NFTs (unless smart contracts)
  - Oil & Gas
  - Governments that are not on my allowlist (or ties with them) 
  - Body Rental consultancy is a **big NO NO** for me, I'm not a commodity and you're not going to make money over my head.
- A good remote policy with a minium of 3 days/week of remote work, although I prefer full remote
- A moonlight policy that allows me to
  - Coach/mentor people 1:1 (off hours)
  - Organize (off hours) - and go (mostly during work hours) - to tech events 
  - Contribute to OSS without needing to ask permission and stuff
- On-call could be fine, but I will be (well) paid for it. I'm not going to be kept awake at night (going to work the day after) for free, sorry!

##### Nice to have

- Operating in the following fields in order of preference:
  - DevTools
  - Green/Blue Energy (susteinability in general is fine)
  - ML/AI
  - Cloud Native tech (Monitoring, Observablity, Security, CI/CD, etc.)
- Being a startup, therefore having low bureaucracy and being able to move fast!
- A full remote policy, remote-first (async tools ftw) and work from anywhere is so cool ü§©
-  A moonlight policy that allows me to also:
   - Advise startups (non-competing)
   - Have my own side projects generating revenues (non-competing) - e.g. writing a book, publishing a fitness app on the app store
- Overall flexibility, here's some examples of what I mean:
  - I don't necessarily like to wake up at 9 AM every day for a standup meeting (that could be done async anyway)
  - I don't really like to be forced to work 9-5, I prefer to work when I'm productive. Never had issues with delivering in all of my previous jobs, I'm a responsible and reliable person.
- A good work and traveling policy
  - I don't want to be forced to take PTOs to travel. 
  - My family and friends live scattered across these countries (and more): Italy, Spain, Germany Netherlands, United States. I will still visit them from time to time.
  - I like going to and organizing conferences, meetups and events. I want to be able to do that without having to take PTOs.

**TLDR; just be a nice company and I will be a nice employee/freelancer for you.**

My physical and mental health has 100% priority over everything else. 

I'm not going to compromise on that and neither should anyone else!

#### Specific to companies in search of a freelancer

I'm always looking for new customers, so if you're looking for a Cloud Native Consultant, feel free to reach out to me.
My starting hourly rate as a freelancer is 125‚Ç¨/hour for enterprise companies.
My daily rate as a freelancer is 1000‚Ç¨/day - 8 hours/day.
Discounts to my freelancer rate are limited to: 
  - courses (I really enjoy teaching)
  - non-for profit organization work
  - meaningful work - e.g. climate change...
  - startups if I really like the idea and the team

I usually prefer to work per-objectives but I'm also open to full-time with some flexibility and limitations to be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 

#### Specific to recruiters or companies in search of an employee

I am actively looking for a job, open to new opportunities.

To have an idea of my salary expectations for a full-time position, as of 2024, is:
- minimum 100k base ‚Ç¨/year (EU remote) + bonus + equity + perks
- minimum 150k base $/year (US remote) + bonus + equity + perks (sponsorship needed)

Just know that I will check my network, levels.fyi and Glassdoor to make sure you're not lowballing me, whoops.

Addressing the elephant in the room: coding riddles, leetcoding, whiteboard interviews, etc. are big red flags for me. üö©üö©üö©

That's why I created [this repo](https://github.com/mbianchidev/coding-challenges) to collect all the coding riddles I will be asked from now on. I'm also trying to collect the ones that I have been asked in the past by some of the companies I interviewed with, such as:
- AWS
- Glovo (I wouldn't apply there again, now that I'm aware of their riders' working conditions)
- Sysdig (they never got back with anything, the hiring manager resigned or something lol)
- Docebo

My success rate at the technical interview stage has been around 80% out of 100+ in the past 9 years, so I'm not afraid of coding interviews. I just don't like to waste my valuable time with self-contained riddles that a new grad could solve by just memorizing algorithms and data structures 101. Reversing a binary tree? Been there, done that, please be smarter and ask something meaningful.

You know what also bogs me? That more often than not these coding interviews have nothing to do with the job I'm applying for... lol.

I also have open-source code on my GitHub profile, so you can check that out if you want to see how I code, right? üòâ

About the numbers of interviews: yes, I do sparring interviews once in a while, just to keep up with the market and understand if I can get a better job than my current one.
