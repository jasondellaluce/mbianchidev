#### Note to recruiters and companies

I consider myself a **Cloud Native Engineer** because I'm not "just" a Software Engineer or DevOps Engineer with extensive Site Reliability experience.
I'm a cloud expert, a DevOps coach, an experienced coder in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Golang, TypeScript...), a mentor, a speaker (coming soon), a tech writer, a community builder and a lot more.
I think differently, I operate differently and I'm certainly not afraid to challenge the status quo.

I don't really like resumes but I have a public one, ask me for it if you really need it.

Regardless of freelancing or employment, from companies I work with I expect the following...

##### Requirements 

- Not operating in the following fields:
  - Military / Weaponry
  - Gambling / Online-Casino
  - Shitcoin (crypto scams) / NFTs (unless smart contracts)
  - Oil & Gas
  - Governments that are not on my allowlist (or ties with them) 
  - Body Rental consultancy is a **big NO NO** for me, I'm not a commodity and you're not going to make money over my head.
- A good remote policy with a minium of 2 days/week of remote work
- A moonlight policy that allows me to
  - Coach/mentor people 1:1 (off hours)
  - Organize (off hours) - and go (mostly during work hours) - to tech events 
  - Contribute to OSS without needing to ask permission and stuff - basically being able to sign CLA
- On-call could be fine, but I will be (well) paid for it. I'm not going to be kept awake at night (going to work the day after) for free, sorry!

##### Nice to have

- Operating in the following fields in order of preference:
  - DevTools
  - Green/Blue Energy (susteinability in general is fine)
  - ML/AI
  - Cloud Native tech (Monitoring, Observablity, Security, CI/CD, etc.)
- Being a startup, therefore having low bureaucracy and being able to move fast!
- A full remote policy, remote-first (async) and work from anywhere is so cool ü§©
-  A moonlight policy that allows me to also:
   - Advise startups (non-competing)
   - Have my own side software projects generating revenues (non-competing)
- Overall flexibility, here's some examples of what I mean:
  - I don't necessarily like to wake up at 9 AM every day for a standup meeting (that could be done async anyway)
  - I don't really like to be forced to work 9-5, I prefer to work when I'm productive. Never had issues with delivering in all of my previous jobs, I'm a responsible and reliable person.
- A good work and traveling policy
  - I don't want to be forced to take PTOs to travel. 
  - My family and friends live scattered across these countries (and more): Italy, Spain, Germany Netherlands, United States. I will still visit them.
  - I like going to and organizing conferences, meetups and events. I want to be able to do that without having to take PTOs.

**TLDR; just be a nice company and I will be a nice employee/freelancer for you.**

My physical and mental health has 100% priority over everything else. 

I'm not going to compromise on that and neither should anyone else!

#### Specific to companies in search of a freelancer

I'm always looking for new customers, so if you're looking for a Cloud Native Consultant, feel free to reach out to me.
My starting hourly rate as a freelancer is 125‚Ç¨/hour for enterprise companies.
My daily rate as a freelancer is 1000‚Ç¨/day - 8 hours/day.
Discounts to my freelancer rate are limited to: 
  - courses (I really enjoy teaching)
  - non-for profit organization work
  - meaningful work - e.g. climate change...
  - startups if I really like the idea and the team

I usually prefer to work per-objectives but I'm also open to full-time with some flexibility and limitations to be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 

#### Specific to recruiters or companies in search of an employee

I am currently **not** actively looking for a job, but I'm always open to new opportunities.

To have an idea of my salary expectations for a full-time position, as of 2023, is:
- min. 100k base ‚Ç¨/year (non-US company) + bonus + equity + perks
- min. 150k base $/year (US company) + bonus + equity + perks

Just know that I will check levels.fyi and Glassdoor to make sure you're not lowballing me.

Addressing the elephant in the room: coding riddles, leetcoding, whiteboard interviews, etc. are a red flag for me. üö©

That's why I created [this repo](https://github.com/mbianchidev/coding-challenges) to collect all the coding riddles I will be asked from now on. I'm also trying to collect the ones that I have been asked in the past by some of the companies I interviewed with, such as:
- AWS
- Glovo (I wouldn't apply there again, now that I'm aware of their riders' working conditions)
- Docebo

My acceptance rate at the tech interview stage has been around 80% out of ~100 in the past 5 years, so I'm not afraid of interviews. I just don't like to waste my valuable time with self-contained coding riddles that a new grad could solve by just memorizing algorithms and data structures.

You know what also bogs me? That more often than not these coding interviews have nothing to do with the job I'm applying for!

I also have open-source code on my GitHub profile, so you can check that out if you want to see how I code, right? üòâ
